## 1) Define the model: Select the type of model and choose its architecture.
## 2) Compile the model: Select a loss function, an algorithm to perform the optimization procedure, performance metrics to track during the training process.
## 3) Fit the model: Training the model requires selecting the training configuration (e.g. number of epochs, the batch size).
## 4) Evaluate the model: Choose a test dataset and get performance metrics that can be reported. 
## 5) Make predictions: Make a prediction of a class label, probability, or numerical value
